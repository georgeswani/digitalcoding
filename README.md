To create a blockchain using Javascript, letâ€™s go through the basics.

Each block in a chain of blocks has a hash of a previous block. In the event of an attack or malicious behavior, the hash is significantly changed, which affects the whole blockchain, freezing it and therefore eliminating the chance of changing the block.
1. Create a Block. Blockchain code example:
2. Create a blockchain:
Make sure that values of the previous and current blocks should match, in order for n the new block to be considered valid.

Validate the chain, checking everything for stability and eliminating vulnerabilities.
